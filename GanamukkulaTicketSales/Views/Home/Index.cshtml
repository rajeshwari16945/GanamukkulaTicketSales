<h1 class="dislay-4">Welcome</h1>
<p>This is a full fledged ASP .NET MVC web application with all ingredients as a precursor to the Entity Framework.</p>
<p>You can turn around and later create this as a database application which is the objective. Therefore, understanding the objects and classes and how they interact with other classes and objects inth framework is really important.</p>
<p>This application has three controllers,  views with a shared layout and five models. In addition there are models that have constructors, which deserve your special attention and understanding.</p>
